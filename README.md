# merge-sort

The repo contains an implementation of the merge-sort algorithm in java.

With a worst-case running time of O(lgn) ignoring constants and lower-order items, the merge-sort algorithm is a a tad faster than the inserstion and selection sort which has a running time of 0(n*n);

To fully understand the merge sort, you'll need a basic to intermediate experience or understanding of recursion in programs.
